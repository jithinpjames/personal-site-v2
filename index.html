        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto 0 auto; text-align: left;">
          <p>I work at the intersection of data, technology, and real-world decision making. My career has been shaped by building large-scale systems in product intelligence, classification, and entity understanding, with a strong focus on practical impact rather than theory alone. I enjoy breaking complex problems into simple, usable structures—whether it’s data pipelines, machine learning systems, or business insights.</p>
          <p>I value first-principles thinking, clarity, and discipline. Much of my learning comes from observing patterns across markets, products, and consumer behavior, and questioning assumptions that are taken for granted. I’m especially interested in how data, economics, and strategy come together to drive better outcomes at scale. I believe good systems and good thinking compound quietly over time.</p>
          <p>Beyond work, I’m deeply influenced by people who demonstrate long-term thinking, strong temperament, and intellectual honesty. I admire builders, strategists, and thinkers who balance ambition with humility, and who stay curious through constant change. This space is a reflection of the ideas, people, and lessons that continue to shape how I think and work.</p>
