        <h1>Prashant Kishor</h1>
        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">
          <p>Prashant Kishor is one of India’s most influential political strategists, known for changing how modern election campaigns are run. He started his career outside politics, working with the United Nations on public health projects, which gave him strong exposure to grassroots realities. This early experience shaped his belief that real change begins with understanding people on the ground, not just speeches or slogans.</p>
          <p>Prashant Kishor brought data, structure, and discipline into Indian political campaigns. Through organizations like I-PAC, he helped leaders convert broad ideas into clear, actionable strategies. His strength lies in breaking complex political problems into simple messages that connect with voters. He focuses heavily on feedback loops—listening to citizens, testing ideas, and correcting course quickly. This approach echoes principles from books like <a href="../books/wisdom_of_crowds.html">"The Wisdom of Crowds,"</a> which argues that collective intelligence often surpasses that of individual experts.</p>
          <p>Another important lesson from Kishor is independence of thinking. He is willing to challenge leaders, walk away from roles, and admit when something does not work. He believes strategy must serve outcomes, not egos. In recent years, his shift toward public movements and political reform shows his long-term view: building systems, leadership, and awareness beyond just winning elections. His journey highlights the power of ground truth, honest data, and courage to rethink paths when needed.</p>
